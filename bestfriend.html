          <h2>Rescue</h2>
          <p>I was found on the side of the road as a kitten with a hurt back leg. The doctors said I was abandoned and then attacked by some small animal.</p>
          <p>I mended well and found my "forever" mom. YAY! I am exceedingly happy where I am, thank you very much!</p>

            <h2>Hide & Pounce</h2>
            <p>Sometimes I'm a bit devious and like to hide and pounce at people. First, life isn't fun if it's always predictable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I'm designed to be camouflaged!</p>

            <h2>Pair Programming</h2>
            <p>I like to help people with their code.</p>
            <p>But let's get real. We're not going to know where the bug is until you RUN the code, mom.</p>

            <p>My leg was hurt as a kitten. But it's fine now!</p>
            <p>Seeeeee? Told you so!</p>

            <h2>Author's Note:</h2>
            <p>Rowan really is my best friend. There is no judgement; there is only love. Even when I don't give treats quite fast enough!</p>
            <p>In a world full of variables, she is my one constant. I hope everyone experiences a love this unconditional in their lives.</p>
